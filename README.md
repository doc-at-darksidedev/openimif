# openimif (Open-sourced image identifer)
Open-sourced tool that uses opencv and tensorflow to 'learn' and identify stuff from images

# How?
- OpenCV is used to manipulate the properties of the image
- Tensorflow is used for the learning of 'elements' within the image

# What can it do? (currently)
- v1.0
> Able to extract digits out of an image

# Todo
1. Fix contour regions (don't scan for the contour within the zero)
2. Increase accuracy for digit recognition

# Getting-started
